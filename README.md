## Coding Exercises

**Use recursion to solve the following problem (unless otherwise stated).**

### 1 — Reverse a String:

This interview question requires you to reverse a string using recursion. Make sure to think of the base case here and make sure you use recursion to accomplish this! Do not use iteration.

### 2 — Fibonnaci Sequence:

Implement a Fibonnaci Sequence in two different ways - iteratively (using a `for`/`while` loop) and recursively. 

* Remember the fibonacci sequence `0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...`. Each number is generated by taking the previous two numbers and adding them together.
* For the purpose of this assignment, the `0th` number is `0` and the `1st` number is `1`. 
* Your function should take in a number `n` and return the `nth` number in the Fibonnaci Sequence. 
* For example, the `fibIter` function should behave like this:

```js
fibIter(0) // returns 0
fibIter(1) // returns 1
fibIter(2) // returns 1
fibIter(3) // returns 2
fibIter(4) // returns 3
fibIter(5) // returns 5
fibIter(6) // returns 8
fibIter(7) // returns 13
```

* `fibRec` should behave the same way!

### 3 — Binary Search:

Write a recursive function called `binarySearch` that takes in two parameters: and array `arr` and a number `target` to find in the array. The function returns the index of `target` in the array `arr`, or `-1` if it can't find `target`.

> Hint: This function may also require other parameters. Look it up!

For Example:
```js
const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16];
const target1 = 8;
const target2 = 12;
const target3 = 7;

console.log(binarySearch(arr, target1)); // Output: 3 (index of target1 in arr)
console.log(binarySearch(arr, target2)); // Output: 5 (index of target2 in arr)
console.log(binarySearch(arr, target3)); // Output: -1 (target3 not found in arr)
```

In these examples:

- We have a sorted array `arr`.
- We're searching for three different targets: `target1`, `target2`, and `target3`.
- The first two calls find the targets (`8` and `12`) in the array and return their respective indices.
- The third call searches for `7`, which is not present in the array, so it returns `-1`.
